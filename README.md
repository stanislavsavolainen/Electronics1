Project 1 : Thermometer -TMP 36 (nodejs - johnny-five) 

-> Project require Uno Arduino R3 and thermometer tmp 36 sensor to
measure temperature data

-> This is modified version from original. I made express -  and mysql - knex module 
extenssion for project to save and display history data of temperature with 10 second measure interval 
to detect new temperature.

-> It will contains hosted html page (in future), where ajax call asking temperature and visualize it at client side using chartjs.

Project 2 : Logic gates 

-> "or_gate.png" picture show closed diagram of OR gate logic using sn7432n chip.

![Alt text](Project2/and_gate.png?)

-> "and_gate.png" picture show closed diagram of AND gate logic using sn74hct08 chip.

![Alt text](Project2/or_gate.png?)

-> "and_gate.png" picture show closed diagram of NOT gate logic using 74hct04n(philips) chip, 
NOT GATE also means inverter / hex inverted chip.

![Alt text](Project2/not_gate.png?)

-> when check this diagram you can be confused about how switches works in practical way. 
That in "OR"- and "AND"-gates switch present 1 in truth table as open ( not electricity flow) and 0
means there is electricty, but led ( light emitting diode ) present oposite logic, where 0 means that 
led is off and 1 means there is light in led.
